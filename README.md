# Instanews App

The goal of this project was to create a website that functionally loads and renders similar to an application, and loads news stories using the New York Times API into the window.

# Built Using

- HTML 5
- CSS 3 
- Visual Studio Code
 - Git Hub
- Google Chrome Developer Tools
- FontSquirrel
- Gulp
- Javascript
- Jquery
- AJAX

# Project Learnings/Takeaways
The main learning elements of this project included using JQuery to dynamically change the structure of the website when options from a button are picked. Using Ajax the data is pulled from the API and populated into fields, as well as manipulating the loaded classes to alter the view of the webpage. The project is built with responsive web design, mobile-first. The structure of this project was different to previous in that I used SCSS to write my CSS and Gulp to automate many of the tasks such as minifying and outputting into a build folder, grabbing vendor prefixes, and linting.
