The goal of this project was to create a website that looks similar to an app in functionality, and loads news stories using the New York Times API into the window.

The main learning elements of this project included using JQuery to dynamically change the structure of the website when options in a <select> button are picked. Using Ajax the data is pulled from the API and populated into fields. These fields change dynamically based on width of the browser using Flexbox.

The structure of this project was also different to previous in that I used Sass to write my CSS and Gulp to automate many of the tasks such as minifying and outputting into a build folder, grabbing vendor prefixes, and linting.
